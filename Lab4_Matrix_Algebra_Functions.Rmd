# Matrix Algebra and Functions

There are five basic data structures in R: vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data.frames. We'll be going through each of these here, but if you want an in depth exploration of these I'd recommend Norman Matloff's *The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design*.

## Matrix basics

Up to this point, we've primarily *talked* about vectors. We've encountered other data types, but haven't used them. Vectors have length, but no width (they can only represent one variable at a time). Matrices are just collections of vectors (exactly like you learned in math camp). We can combine them by column using \texttt{cbind}, or by row, using \texttt{rbind}. We then access elements of matrix by \texttt{matrix[row, column]}.
